<p><h1>XP and levels</h1>
Generally, you earn XP by going on adventures and doing other cool stuff. The referee should award the xp whenever it is deemed appropriate.<br>

Every time you get 1 XP, you get 3 Attribute Points, which you can assign to improve your current stats, using the conversion table from page 1. (As a rule, to increase a stat from ​n ​to ​n​+1, you need ​n​+1 Attribute Points. For example, increasing a stat from 5 to 6 takes 6 Attribute Points.) You may also choose to hold onto your new Attribute Points and spend them later. Keep track of how many you’ve got stored. You can spend them to improve a stat anytime, as long as your character isn’t busy fighting or whatever.<br>

You start at level 1 with 0 XP. Every time you get 3 XP, you level up. Every time you reach an even-numbered level, your attribute score maximum goes up by 1 (from 5 to 6 at level 2, then from 6 to 7 at level 4, and so on).</p>

<p><h1>Legend Points</h1>
You begin the game with 6 Legend Points. They replenish every time you level up. You can spend a Legend Point at any time to do any of the following:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Reroll any check and take the best result.</li>
    <li>Heal to 1 Hit Point. ​You may spend this immediately after sustaining a death blow to automatically succeed in the check.</li>
<li> Know some erudite thing​. Within reason. You need to explain how your character knows this. It can be something you make up, or something the referee has to tell you.</li>
    <li>Switch to or from an alternate form.​ You must have one.</li>
    <li>Make up an NPC connection. ​In any situation, you can go “I know a guy” and give a quick  run-down of someone your character knows. That character becomes real. You can give them wealth, prestige, guild memberships etc, but of course the referee gets to decide how much they really care about you. If you have some magical abilities, you can alternatively call on some supernatural being and make a contract with it.</li>
    <li>Try anything else the rules would not normally allow you to do.​ Within reason.</li>
</ul>
