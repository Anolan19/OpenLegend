<p><h1>Rolling Dice in Combat</h1>
Whenever you want to do something, roll a d20 plus the relevant stat dice. If you get the max roll on any die, roll another one of the same kind and add it to the total.<br>
You’re trying to hit a target number, but no roll in Open Legend ever just “fails”. Things either go horribly wrong or sort of okay (or they succeed). If you roll 10 or more under the desired roll, you fail in a way that goes immediately wrong for you. If you roll within 10 of the desired roll, you succeed (kinda), but things are still going bad. If you roll the desired thing, you just succeed—and you, the player, describe the way in which you succeed. (The referee describe the way you fail.) This game will be very light on “filler” rolls—most of the time, if you’re rolling a die, it’s crucially important, and everything else is an automatic success or fail.<br>
(The referee just fails, and does not get any of these benefits.)<br>
You can succeed critically if you roll 10 or more over what you needed to roll. Every increment of 10 makes your critical hit a little better.<br>
Good or bad circumstances can grant you​ advantage ​or​ disadvantage​ ​to varying degrees. When you roll with advantage, you roll a number of extra stat dice equal to the advantage number (which ranges from 1 to 10) and pick just the best rolls (with disadvantage, pick just the worst).<br></p>
<p><h1>Turn-Based Combat</h1>
Individuals roll Speed to determine the order of play. Each player, on their turn, may take one Major Action and one Move Action.
Your Move Action is pretty self-explanatory. You move about 25 feet per round, plus 5 feet per point of Speed. You may also skip your Move Action to try resisting any condition that’s affecting you.
For your Major Action, you can attack, take a simple or complex special action, take an extra Move Action (note that this means you can defer your whole turn for two free Dodges), or assist an ally in doing their own Major Action (or whatever).
</p>

<p><h1>HP, Damage and Death</h1>
Your hit points are an abstract measure of your capacity to roll with hits, bite through pain, and maintain a presence on the battlefield despite pain and exhaustion. They don’t necessarily represent actual battle wounds. It takes 10 minutes of non-stressful activity to heal yourself up to full HP.
When you reach 0 or less hit points, you don’t go unconscious (unless you want to), but every hit against you after this point counts as a​ death blow​. When you get hit by a death blow, you roll a Health or Grit check and try to exceed 5 + amount of damage sustained. If you fail, you just die. (If you fail by less than 10, you get one final heroic action before you die.)
A hit on an immobile, unconscious, or otherwise defenseless creature, or a hit on a creature that’s not expecting it, also counts as a death blow.
Some effects will deal ​ugly​ damage—in particular traps, environmental hazards and other one-shot dangers (since those things would pose no threat at all if you could just heal back from them). Ugly damage detracts from your current and maximum HP all at once. You heal 1 point of ugly damage per day, +1 for each point of Health you have, until you’ve reached your original HP maximum. If your max HP hits 0 due to ugly damage, you die.
If a combat blow deals over 20 damage to you, all damage past the first 20 points is counted as ugly damage.
</p>
<p><h1>Defending</h1>
Defenses are static numbers based on your attributes.<br>
<b>BodyDefense: </b> ​10 + Health + Grit <br>
This is your defence against physical ailments. Things like a splash of acid to the face, a spell that grants a disease or a horrific stench attack by a zombie<br><br>
<b>Mind Defense: </b>​10 + Wits + Grace<br>
This is your ability to withstand a horrible invasion of your mind or stay sand after witnessing something that would make most people go insane. Mainly for things like spells that assault the mind, but also can be used to ward off other assaults of the mind. <br><br>
<b>Guard Defense:</b> ​10 + Might + Speed + gear bonus Hit Points: ​10 + twice Health + Grit + Grace<br>
Guard represents the character's abilities to deflect, avoid or otherwise not take damage from an attack. When a character makes an attack against an opponent, they roll their attack role (as discussed below) against this guard defence. The role minus this defence is the amount of damage dealt. <br>
</p>

<p><h1>Attacking</h1>
Attacking works the same as any other die roll. When you attack, you try to exceed your enemy’s defense (usually Guard, but sometimes Body or Mind in the case of magic attacks). If you fail to hit, you do one of the following four things for free, and the enemy also does one of the things for free:<br>
<ul>
<li>Push the Aggression: ​Deal 3 damage.</li>
    <li>Shift: ​Moves 10 feet.</li>
    <li>Force Move: ​Move target 5 feet.</li>
    <li>Choose a simple special action, or do some other minor thing.</li>
</ul><br>
If you fail by over 10, only the enemy gets to pick a failure mode.<br>
If you succeed, then you deal damage equal to the difference between your attack roll and the
enemy’s defense. You can replace this success with any of the failure modes above. If you succeed by 10 or more, you get a free failure mode and also do all the damage. <br>
You can’t attack with just a d20—you need some kind of stat to go along with it. The following stats can be easily used to attack:
<ul>
    <li>Might (with a melee weapon, a thrown object, or your bare fists)</li>
    <li>Speed (with a quick melee weapon like a dagger)</li>
    <li>Senses (with a ranged weapon like a bow)</li>
    <li>Sneak (with a hidden blade or an attack they weren’t expecting)</li>
    <li>Hex</li>
    <li>Attune</li></ul><br>
With Hex and Attune, you don’t need any specific item to make an attack, but you’ll have to describe what kind of form your magic is taking. The other stats require you to have some kind of weapon. You might roll disadvantage if it’s not a familiar kind of weapon.
</ul>
</p>
<p><h1>Ranged attacks and multi-target attacks</h1>
Offensive special actions have to be delivered pretty much the same way attacks are. If your attack or action is material, your range is the range or reach of your weapons. Bows can probably get like 100 feet out, and slings maybe 50 feet. If your attack is magical, you have a range of 30 feet, plus 5 feet per point you have in that magical attribute. You can’t target things you can’t see.<br>
You can target multiple creatures with the same attack or special action. Personify it as a huge swing, a thousand stabs, a ricocheting arrow, a big fireball, or whatever. Roll against each creature separately. Roll with disadvantage equal to the number of targets you have. For example, if you’re targeting two people, you have disadvantage 2.<br>
With magic only, you can manifest an attack or action as affecting a whole area. Draw the area out of 5-foot-by-5-foot-by-5-foot cubes. You roll with disadvantage equal to half the number of cubes you draw in constructing this area, rounded up.</p>
