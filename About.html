<h1>Legal Stuff</h1>
This game is based off of the rpg called open legend. It is an open source RPG that has many features that make for a great game. We want to innovate on that. As programmers, we also figured that the best place to place our project was on github. The following is the statement that they ask us to share to use their content.<br>
