<p><h1>Equipment</h1>
The equipment you can obtain is based on your Wealth score. You can buy any number of items with a Wealth score lower than your own. You can buy 1 item with a Wealth score equal to yours every 2 weeks. You can’t buy items with Wealth scores that are 2 or more over your own Wealth score; you can buy an item that’s 1 Wealth higher once, but doing so permanently lowers your Wealth by 1.
                     You can carry a maximum of 20 items. Some items are heavy (I’ll tell you which ones); you can carry a number of heavy items equal to your Might score. Some items are bulky—you can carry one bulky item with no penalties, but two bulky items will reduce your speed to 5’ per round.
                     Functionality of gear is mostly played as “if it makes sense, go with it”. The only rule we need to make is the bonuses that armor gives to Guard. Leather armor gives you +1 to Guard; studded leather and chain shirts give you +2; chainmail, banded mail and the like gives you +3; splint mail and plate mail give you +4; and full plate armor gives you +5.</p>
