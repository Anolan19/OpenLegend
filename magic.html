<h1>The Four Schools of Magic</h1>
<p><h2>Conjure</h2>
Applied apparition. Summon creatures that fight for you, conjure useful items, teleport, banish monsters, jaunt to the astral plane, make packs with eldritch entities.
</p>

<p><h2>Hex</h2>
Death magic and witchcraft. Send curses, pull ghoulish pranks, speak with the dead, raise corpses, blight crops, kill with a word.
</p>

<p><h2>Attune</h2>
Mastery of nature and the elements. Throw fireballs, heal wounds, animate trees, calm the waves, change the weather, send gusts of wind, raise up walls of stone.

</p>
<p><h2>Scry</h2>
Knowing things you shouldnâ€™t know. Get odd intuitions, send thoughts, see far away, read minds, peer on ancient lore, dredge memories, predict the future.
