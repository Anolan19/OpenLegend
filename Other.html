<p><h1>XP and levels</h1>
Generally, you earn XP by going on adventures and doing other cool stuff. The referee should award the xp whenever it is deemed appropriate.<br>

Every time you get 1 XP, you get 3 Attribute Points, which you can assign to improve your current stats, using the conversion table from page 1. (As a rule, to increase a stat from ​n ​to ​n​+1, you need ​n​+1 Attribute Points. For example, increasing a stat from 5 to 6 takes 6 Attribute Points.) You may also choose to hold onto your new Attribute Points and spend them later. Keep track of how many you’ve got stored. You can spend them to improve a stat anytime, as long as your character isn’t busy fighting or whatever.<br>

You start at level 1 with 0 XP. Every time you get 3 XP, you level up. Every time you reach an even-numbered level, your attribute score maximum goes up by 1 (from 5 to 6 at level 2, then from 6 to 7 at level 4, and so on).</p>
